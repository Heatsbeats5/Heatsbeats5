            <h1>Grade School</h1>
          <p>The School I’ve enrolled is Ormoc City Central School
            (OCCS) since the school is near our Barangay where we live
            and our barangay is just at the back of the school. In my
            elementary days I am one of the noisiest or talkative among
            my classmate. These days I experience super typhoon
            Yolanda we evacuated in the school during the typhoon.
            After the typhoon pass, we sleep at the hotel where our
            aunt is staying so we are comfortable to sleep and, in the
            morning, I’ve seen the devastation the typhoon has bring
            luckily theirs no one in the family got hurt. Also, in these
            days we welcome our new youngest member of our family
            my sister princess. After that my mother has a disease that
            needs operation so every day after school, we visited her in
            the hospital where she has been admitted.</p>

            <h1>Junior High School</h1>
          <p>In the Junior High School days, I enrolled on Western Leyte College
            (WLC). I enrolled there because my parents graduated there so they
            have trust that the school well provide good education for me but these
            days since I am a teenager sometimes, I cut class so we can play games
            in the computer shop. There was even a time that we are caught by our
            teacher’s and principal. But in these days one of the most tragic
            moments, I couldn’t forget is the day when my father dies this day, I
            feel like I am not myself anymore that something is missing from me.
            But I got through it somehow but from that day I became a silent type
            of person and I don’t like to go outside anymore. I couldn’t forget that
            day but we need to go forward because I know my father would want
            me to be successful someday. In these days also I am an honor student
            not always though because sometimes the lesson is harder.</p>

            <h1>Senior High School</h1>
          <p>In Senior High School, I enrolled on Ormoc City Senior High School
            (OCSHS) because of the financial problem cause by when my mother loss
            her job so I transferred in the public school to stabilize our financial
            needs. In these days I meet new classmates and meet new friends. I also
            learned many skills during these days related to computers. I graduated
            honor student but since there is no graduation cause by the pandemic.
            There is no graduation ceremony we just take the certificate then that’s
            all we didn’t even see our classmate one last time.</p>
